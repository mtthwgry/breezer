# breezer
This is an application built for [Breeze's engineering challenge](http://www.github.com/joinbreeze/map-challenge). It visualizes the dataset through an interactive map-based interface. You can filter markers by user and transaction type. Clicking on a name will add that user's markers to the map. Each user is given a randomly generated color.

## Technologies Used
- Rails 4.2
- Ruby 2.2.0
- Rspec 3.2.3 with shoulda-matchers
